            <p>This is a game of guessing, strategy and logical thought which dates back to before world war one. It is a two player game which has been released by many board game manufactures and has also been put into physical and digital renditions, with a 2012 Hollywood film based on the game being made.</p>

            <p>Each game can vary in the number of ships employed but a common practice is to have 5 ships of differing size (2 to 5) squares. An aircraft carrier is 5 squares long, a battleship is 4 squares long, both a submarine and a destroyer are three squares long and a patrol boat is two squares long. Each player must secretly place their ships on a grid of ten columns by ten rows. These represent the location of the ships on a battlefield. Each player will also be in possession of a second grid of the same size. Where the first grid is their own ships, the second one (which is blank at the beginning of the game) is a mirror of their opponent’s battlefield.</p>

                <p>Once it is determined who will go first, that person will pick a square at random, calling it by its reference of column reference, row number (C3 for example). This represents their firing a missile directly at that square. If the opposing player has any part of one of their ships positioned on this square they must call “hit” and mark on their battlefield (first grid) which part has been hit. Equally the attacking player will place an “X” on their blank grid (the mirror of their opponents field) to show a hit. It is then the opponents turn to fire.</p>

            <p>The player who successfully sinks all of their opponent’s ships first is the winner.</p>
