# Battleship Game

This project is my attempt to remake the classic Battleship game. It currently only supports a PVE environment.

Implementing everything from the interdependent systems to the automatic ship placement for the comptuer, was an awesome experience that challenged me on all fronts.

### Future Features
- A 2-Player experience
- Images for each type of ship
- A more advanced ship placement algorithm
